This is a repository of my attempts at the problems on projecteuler.net in Perl.

Thanks are due in particular to the members of the website, projecteuler.net, for providing intriguing ideas and more elegant solutions to problems I had previously solved.
Thanks are also due to Muhammed Uluyol, for introducing me to the site and inspiring me to start my own solutions repository
